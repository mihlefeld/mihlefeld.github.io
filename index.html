                    Bachelor thesis. Using quality values from
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06627">MagFace</a> in the
                    Comparison function to improve recognition performance. In the graphic below we can see a modelled
                    face recognition scenario. We consider pairs of face images that either belong to the same person
                    (genuine pairs) or to different persons (imposter pairs). For each pair we compute the standard
                    comparison score (Cosine Similarity) and take the minimum of the two quality values. When plotting
                    the genuine and imposter distribution we can see that the ideal decision boundary follows a curve
                    because low-quality image pairs with a slightly below average comparison score are likely genuine
                    pairs. However, when thresholding on the standard comparison score, we can not make use of this
                    observation, for this reason we proposed the QMagFace comparison score.

                    with the <a href="https://reinierschippers.nl/oll_trainer-master-beta/">existing tools</a>. So, I took it upon myself
                    to make an improved version, building upon what was already there. Once I was finished with the Megaminx algorithm trainer, 
                    I added alg-trainers for different events as well, resulting in 7 different trainers for 4 different puzzles, Megaminx, Skewb, Pyraminx
                    and 2x2.

                    Havasi et al propose a new technique to train Deep Ensembles using just a single network.
                    We followed the approach of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13065">Cygert et al 2021</a> who
                    applied
                    MIMO ensembling
                    to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497">Faster R-CNN</a> and applied this ensembling technique

                    desired.

                    called
                    Domino Reduction explained in much detail by <a href="http://kociemba.org/cube.htm">Herbert
                        Kociemba</a>,
                    it is the first step of the two-phase algorithm for solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Because humans
                    usually
                    can't
                    easily find a direct solution after Domino Reduction (DR), people started further reducing the
                    subset to
                    just 180Â°
                    turns [U2, D2, R2, L2, F2, B2]. This is called Half Turn Reduction (HTR), together with another
                    friend
                    we wanted
                    to figure out "What is the distrubtion of optimal moves to achieve HTR when considering all possible
                    starting DRs".
                    To answer this question we wrote a solver in Julia, and then ported it to C++, adding
                    multi-threading to
                    speed up
                    the processing.

                    University Project. GIF is a common file format to come across, especially on the web. However, to
                    save
                    an image as
                    a GIF, one has to define a palette with a maximum number of 256 colors, no other colors can be used
                    in
                    the image.
                    Because of this, there is usually a significant loss in quality when converting to GIF. To mitigate
                    this, we can
                    use color dithering. The most common technique for color dithering is the Floyd-Steinberg Dithering
                    algorithm.
                    In this University project I implemented and extended a modern version of the "Dithered Color
                    Quantization" paper by
                    Buhmann et al.

                    Side Project. A friend asked me a question about calculating a combinatorial value. After solving
                    the
                    problem I joined in on his project by implementing a competing Simple Tafl solver.
                    <a href="http://aagenielsen.dk/simple_hnefatafl_rules.php">Simple Tafl</a> is a version of the board
                    game <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hnefatafl">Hnefatafl</a> with a simplified ruleset.
                    By additionally decreasing the board size, we hoped to decrease the complexity enough to make it
                    fully solvable.

                    The <a href="https://github.com/extra-p/extrap">Extra-P</a> project aims at making it easier to
                    identify scaling bugs
                    by modelling program performance as a multi-dimensional function of a number of parameters. Possible
                    parameters could
                    be anything related to problem size or the number of cores solving the problem. One option to find
                    the closest
                    match of a performance model is to try all combinations of parameter multiplication and addition and
                    subsequently
                    solving for the best coefficients. However, trying out all combinations grows exponentially as we
                    increase the number of
                    parameters. As part of this university project we took existing Python code implementing
                    multi-parameter performance
                    modelling and ported it to C++ with CUDA. Due to a minimal representation of the problem at hand and
                    intensive
                    performance optimization we were able to achieve a speedup of up to 100'000x depending on GPU model
                    and the number
                    of parameters.

                    As part of their bachelor thesis another student implemented a Tensorflow model which can
                    reconstruct maksed parts
                    of a face. In this university project we implemented a program to interactively demonstrate the
                    face-completion
                    algorithm of the bachelor student. For the UI we used python Qt bindings.

                    Because we finished the "Face Completion Demonstrator" early we started a second project as part of
                    the same university
                    course. In this project we implemented a simple UI where a face detection system scans the current
                    webcam feed and draws
                    bounding boxes around each detected face. Additionally, a quality score is computed following
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09373">TerhÃ¶rst et al 2020</a> and visualized by coloring the
                    boxes.
                    It is then also possible to enroll new faces into the system and the demonstrator will recognize any
                    enrolled person.
